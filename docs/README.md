## What is it
The Community Game Development Toolkit is a set of tools that make it easy and fun for students, artists, researchers and community members to create their own visually rich, interactive 3D environments and story-based games without the use of coding or other specialized game-design skills. Building on the popular 3D game design engine Unity, the toolkit provides intuitive tools for diverse communities to represent their own traditions, rituals and heritages through interactive, visual storytelling. Projects can be built for desktop, mobile and VR applications.

##Toolkit functionality

* Use your own drawings, paintings and cuts out from photos to create 3D scenes
*  Intuitively drag and drop drawings, paintings and photo cut outs into scenes -- toolkit automatically formats images
*   Use transparency in drawings, paintings and photo cut outs to easily create rich, organic visual composition in 3D space
*   Take your own 360-degree photos and use as interactive, photogarphic backgrounds to your scenes
*   Use a flying player (moves freely through 3D space) or a grounded player (moves along a ground plane in the scene) to interact with your scenes
*   Create Scene Change elements -- when the player moves through specified visual elements, they are transported to another scene. Simply designate an element as a scene change, and select the scene the player should be transported to
*   Use scene changes to create interactive visual narrative

## Coming soon
* Use video/moving image textures
* Interactive text
* Simple animated materials
* Title screens and pause screens
* VR pipeline  
* And more...

## Long Term Goals
* Arrange and compose visual assets in an interactive game mode rather than in the Unity Editor
* Create scene changes in an interactive game mode
* --> provide workflow for avoiding the use of the Untiy environment all together
* Arrange and compose scenes in VR
* Create web-based database of projects created using the toolkit
