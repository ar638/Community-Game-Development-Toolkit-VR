# Installing Unity
Before you can begin using the Community Game Development Toolkit, you must download Unity, but worry not! This tutorial will provide you with step by step instructions to make sure installing Unity is as easy as possible. This tutorial is geared towards Mac users, but installing on Windows is a very similar process.

### Downloading Unity

First, you have to download Unity at: [https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).

As you can see, there are two versions of Unity to download. Unity hubs is the free one, so that's the version this tutorial will follow, but if you'd like to purchase Unity Pro, go for it!

### Installing Unity Hubs

Next, open up the file you just downloaded. You should see a screen like this:

Click agree, and then drag and drop the Unity Hub icon into the Applications folder. It will then start to install!

### Installing Unity

Once Unity Hubs has installed, you must then install the latest version of Unity into your Unity Hubs.

Finally, you must agree to the End User License Agreement. Once you do, Unity will begin to install. It might take quite a while, so don't worry!

### Activating Your License

To use Unity, you must have a license. Open Unity Hubs and sign in with your Unity ID if you already have a Unity account. If not, you can create one by visiting the Unity ID website: [https://id.unity.com/en/account/edit](https://id.unity.com/en/account/edit). Once you've logged, in, click on the settings icon in the top right corner and go to the License Management tab.

Click Activate New License and then choose which type of license you'd like to activate. The Unity Personal License is free, so that's the one most of you will be using. If you do have Unity Plus or Unity Pro, licenses for those versions are available as well.
